RSA Factoring Challenge
=======================

This project is part of the RSA Factoring Challenge, where the goal is to factorize large natural numbers into a product of two smaller numbers. The challenge involves optimizing the algorithm to run efficiently within a time limit.


Description
-----------

The program reads a file containing a list of natural numbers (one per line) and factorizes each number into two factors

* 𝑝 × 𝑞 = 𝑛

The factorization result is output in the format _n=p*q_ for each number in the file.


Usage
-----

The program takes one argument, the file containing the numbers to be factorized:


```bash

./factors <file>

```

* <file>: A file containing natural numbers (one per line) to factorize.
